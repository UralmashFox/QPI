# Quantum image representation

The underlined representations are already implemented in the current repo.

Implementations also include some of the image processing procedures which are discribed [here](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-981-32-9331-1.pdf).

Some attention to the Classical-to-quantum and Quantum-to-classical interfaces ([C2QI and Q2CI](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-014-0881-0))
and [testing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-016-1457-y) with it the reliability of the quantum representation methods.
